                <h1>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</h1>
                <div class="story-body">
                    <p>There was no mirror, at that date, in my room; that which stands beside me as I write, was brought
                        there later on and for the very purpose of these transformations. The night however, was far gone into
                        the morning--the morning, black as it was, was nearly ripe for the conception of the day--the inmates
                        of my house were locked in the most rigorous hours of slumber; and I determined, flushed as I was with
                        hope and triumph, to venture in my new shape as far as to my bedroom. I crossed the yard, wherein the
                        constellations looked down upon me, I could have thought, with wonder, the first creature of that sort
                        that their unsleeping vigilance had yet disclosed to them; I stole through the corridors, a stranger in
                        my own house; and coming to my room, I saw for the first time the appearance of Edward Hyde.</p>

                    <p>I must here speak by theory alone, saying not that which I know, but that which I suppose to be most
                        probable. The evil side of my nature, to which I had now transferred the stamping efficacy, was less
                        robust and less developed than the good which I had just deposed. Again, in the course of my life, which
                        had been, after all, nine tenths a life of effort, virtue and control, it had been much less exercised
                        and much less exhausted. And hence, as I think, it came about that Edward Hyde was so much smaller,
                        slighter and younger than Henry Jekyll. Even as good shone upon the countenance of the one, evil was
                        written broadly and plainly on the face of the other. Evil besides (which I must still believe to be
                        the lethal side of man) had left on that body an imprint of deformity and decay. And yet when I looked
                        upon that ugly idol in the glass, I was conscious of no repugnance, rather of a leap of welcome. This,
                        too, was myself. It seemed natural and human. In my eyes it bore a livelier image of the spirit, it
                        seemed more express and single, than the imperfect and divided countenance I had been hitherto
                        accustomed to call mine. And in so far I was doubtless right. I have observed that when I wore the
                        semblance of Edward Hyde, none could come near to me at first without a visible misgiving of the flesh.
                        This, as I take it, was because all human beings, as we meet them, are commingled out of good and evil:
                        and Edward Hyde, alone in the ranks of mankind, was pure evil.</p>

                    <p>I lingered but a moment at the mirror: the second and conclusive experiment had yet to be attempted;
                        it yet remained to be seen if I had lost my identity beyond redemption and must flee before daylight
                        from a house that was no longer mine; and hurrying back to my cabinet, I once more prepared and drank
                        the cup, once more suffered the pangs of dissolution, and came to myself once more with the character,
                        the stature and the face of Henry Jekyll.</p>

                    <p>That night I had come to the fatal cross-roads. Had I approached my discovery in a more noble spirit,
                        had I risked the experiment while under the empire of generous or pious aspirations, all must have been
                        otherwise, and from these agonies of death and birth, I had come forth an angel instead of a fiend. The
                        drug had no discriminating action; it was neither diabolical nor divine; it but shook the doors of the
                        prisonhouse of my disposition; and like the captives of Philippi, that which stood within ran forth. At
                        that time my virtue slumbered; my evil, kept awake by ambition, was alert and swift to seize the
                        occasion; and the thing that was projected was Edward Hyde. Hence, although I had now two haracters as
                        well as two appearances, one was wholly evil, and the other was still the old Henry Jekyll, that
                        incongruous compound of whose reformation and improvement I had already learned to despair. The movement
                        was thus wholly toward the worse.</p>

                    <p>Even at that time, I had not conquered my aversions to the dryness of a life of study. I would still
                        be merrily disposed at times; and as my pleasures were (to say the least) undignified, and I was not
                        only well known and highly considered, but growing towards the elderly man, this incoherency of my life
                        was daily growing more unwelcome. It was on this side that my new power tempted me until I fell in
                        slavery. I had but to drink the cup, to doff at once the body of the noted professor, and to assume,
                        like a thick cloak, that of Edward Hyde. I smiled at the notion; it seemed to me at the time to be
                        humourous; and I made my preparations with the most studious care. I took and furnished that house in
                        Soho, to which Hyde was tracked by the police; and engaged as a housekeeper a creature whom I knew well
                        to be silent and unscrupulous. On the other side, I announced to my servants that a Mr. Hyde (whom I
                        described) was to have full liberty and power about my house in the square; and to parry mishaps, I even
                        called and made myself a familiar object, in my second character. I next drew up that will to which you
                        so much objected; so that if anything befell me in the person of Dr. Jekyll, I could enter on that of
                        Edward Hyde without pecuniary loss. And thus fortified, as I supposed, on every side, I began to profit
                        by the strange immunities of my position.</p>

                    <p>Men have before hired bravos to transact their crimes, while their own person and reputation sat under
                        shelter. I was the first that ever did so for his pleasures. I was the first that could plod in the
                        public eye with a load of genial respectability, and in a moment, like a schoolboy, strip off these
                        lendings and spring headlong into the sea of liberty. But for me, in my impenetrable mantle, the safety
                        was complete. Think of it--I did not even exist! Let me but escape into my laboratory door, give me but a
                        second or two to mix and swallow the draught that I had always standing ready; and whatever he had done,
                        Edward Hyde would pass away like the stain of breath upon a mirror; and there in his stead, quietly at
                        home, trimming the midnight lamp in his study, a man who could afford to laugh at suspicion, would be
                        Henry Jekyll.</p>
